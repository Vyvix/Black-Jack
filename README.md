The project consists of 3 main parts:
- Login / Register
- Encryption
- Games



The main goal of the project is to enable the playing of popular games that we can often find in a casino, without spending real money, but more for: Recreation, Exercise and Fun



Login / Register:



The registry system is a code that asks the new / unregistered user for "Username" and "Password", it is checked if the password is strong enough (It has more than 8 characters, It has a capital letter, Mix of letters and numbers ...),
The password is then encrypted with the encryption code which is explained a little later and sent to an online database, the password is written under an unencrypted username,
and the user's "cash account" is registered under the encrypted username so that it can not be accessed by anyone other than the program.



A login system is a code that asks the unannounced but logged in user for a "Username" and "Password" which it then encrypts and checks if it is correct.



Encryption:



An encryption system is a code that encrypts data, although it is small, it is very effective and it is impossible to decrypt the encrypted data, this is because there are only 2 rules in the encryption code:
- Encryption is performed by selecting 1 "random" symbol from many rare symbols that are hidden from the audience for each character in the data (letter, number, character ...)

- The same password symbols are always selected

This is done by placing a 'seed' that is hidden from the audience



Games:
There is currently only 1 game in the program, BlackJack, which is currently the most played casino game with 3x players than Poker, in the future I plan to add 6 more popular games,
